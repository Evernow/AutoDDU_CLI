# AutoDDU_CLI

![](Chikaftw_upscaled.png)


This is an attempt to automate as much as possible for the end user, while also being maintainable and requiring time spent to maintain it overtime.

## Requirements (these are all handled automatically):
- [FIDO](https://github.com/pbatard/Fido): Used to know which is the latest Windows release
- [24HS-CommonSoftware](https://github.com/24HourSupport/CommonSoftware) - Used to grab latest GPU drivers and 7zip
- [PCI ID Database](http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/) - Used to know what GPU we're working with
-
